## Tasks

### Basic_SQL

#### File: basics.sql

The Basic_SQL section focused on fundamental SQL operations such as table creation, modification, and data manipulation. Processes included operations like deleting table fields, assigning data to specific records, and removing entire tables.

### Triggers_functions_procedures

#### Files: function.sql, procedure.sql, trigger.sql

This section covered advanced SQL constructs such as functions, procedures, and triggers. It discussed creating functions that return specific results based on queries, procedures for data processing, and triggers for automating database actions like data archiving before changes.

### Transactions_concurrency

#### Files: script1_1.sql, script1_2.sql, script2_1.sql, script2_2.sql, script3_1.sql, script3_2.sql, script6_1.sql, script6_2.sql, session4_1.sql, session4_2.sql, session5_1.sql, session5_2.sql

The Transactions_concurrency section dealt with transaction isolation and concurrency management in data access. It included tests on concurrent transactions that may lead to issues such as data locks or unexpected results due to insufficient transaction isolation.

### Administrating

#### File: administrating.sql

Administrating focused on database management and user permissions. It covered creating administrative logs, managing logins and users by assigning and revoking permissions, defining user roles, and their data operation privileges.
